I've been draggin' around
from the end of your coat for two weeks
everywhere you go is swirlin'
everything you say has water under it
you know, I keep your fingerprints
in a pink folder in the middle of my table
you're the tall kingdom I surround
think I'd better follow you around

you might need me more
than you think you will
come home in the car you love
brainy, brainy, brainy

I've been draggin' around
from the end of your coat for two weeks
you keep changing your fancy, fancy mind
every time I decide to let go
I was up all night again
boning up and reading the American Dictionary
you'll never believe me, what I found
think I'd better follow you around

you might need me more
than you think you will
come home in the car you love
brainy, brainy, brainy
